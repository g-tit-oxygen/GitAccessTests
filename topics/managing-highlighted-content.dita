    <p>While working with XML documents you often have frequent changes to the structure and
      content. You are often faced with a situation where you need to make a slight change in
      multiple places in the same document. <ph keyref="product"/> includes a feature,
        <uicontrol>Manage Highlighted Content</uicontrol>, that is designed to help you achieve
      this.</p>
    <p>When you are in <uicontrol>Text</uicontrol> mode and you perform a search operation or apply
      an XPath that highlights multiple results, you can select the <uicontrol>Manage
        Highlighted Content</uicontrol> action from the contextual menu of any highlight in the
      document, and the following options are available in its submenu:<ul>
        <li>
          <uicontrol>Modify All</uicontrol> - Use this option to modify (in-place) all the
          occurrences of the selected content. When you use this option, a thin rectangle replaces
          the highlights and allows you to start editing. If matches with different letter cases are
          found, a dialog box is displayed that allows you select whether you want to modify only
          matches with the same letter case or all matches.<note>If you select a very large number
            of highlights that you want to modify using this feature, a dialog box informs you that
            you may experience performance issues. You have the option to either use the <xref
              href="find-replace-dialog.dita#find-replace-dialog"
                ><uicontrol>Find/Replace</uicontrol> operation</xref>, or continue the
            operation.</note></li>
        <li>
          <uicontrol>Surround All</uicontrol> - Use this option to surround the highlighted content
          with a specific tag. This option opens the <uicontrol>Tag</uicontrol> dialog box. The
            <uicontrol>Specify the tag</uicontrol> drop-down menu presents all the available
          elements that you can choose from. </li>
        <li>
          <uicontrol>Remove All</uicontrol> - Removes all the highlighted content. </li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>If you right-click content in another part of the document, other than a highlight, you have
      the option to select the following option:<ul id="ul_pnd_vlj_cs">
        <li><uicontrol>Modify All Matches</uicontrol> - Use this option to modify (in-place) all the
          occurrences of the selected content (or the contiguous fragment in which the cursor is
          located). When you use this option, a thin rectangle replaces the highlights and allows
          you to start editing. If matches with different letter cases are found, a dialog box is
          displayed that allows you select whether you want to modify only matches with the same
          letter case or all matches.</li>
      </ul></p>
