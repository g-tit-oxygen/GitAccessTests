  <title>Gray Window on Linux With the Compiz / Beryl Window Manager</title>

      <title>Problem</title>
      <p>I try to run <ph keyref="product"/> on Linux with the Compiz / Beryl window manager but I
        get only a gray window that does not respond to user actions. Sometimes the <ph
          keyref="product"/> window responds to user actions but after opening and closing an <ph
          keyref="product"/> dialog or after resizing the <ph keyref="product"/> window or a view of
        the <ph keyref="product"/> window the content of this window becomes gray and it does not
        respond to user actions. What is wrong?</p>

      <p>Sun Microsystems' Java virtual machine <xref
          href="http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6429775" scope="external"
          format="html">does not support the Compiz window manager and the Beryl one very
          well</xref>. It is expected that better support for Compiz / Beryl will be added in future
        versions of their Java virtual machine. You should turn off the special effects of the
        Compiz / Beryl window manager before starting the <ph keyref="product"/> application or
        switch to other window manager.</p>
