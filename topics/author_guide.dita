        <p>The <b>Content Author</b> refers to a user who creates documentation in Oxygen XML Editor
      or Oxygen XML Author and who has installed the <b>Oxygen Content Fusion Connector</b> add-on
      to gain access to the <uicontrol>Content Fusion Tasks Manager</uicontrol> view. The <b>Content
        Author</b> uses this view to create a task that contains files that need to be reviewed by
      others. The <b>Content Author</b> then uploads the task to the <ph keyref="product"/> server
      and shares a link to it with one or more <b>Reviewers</b>. During the review process, the
        <b>Content Author</b> and all of the <b>Reviewers</b> can communicate directly in the <ph
        keyref="product"/> interface and once the process is finished, the <b>Content Author</b> has
      a convenient built-in <i>Merge</i> tool to integrate all the changes back into Oxygen XML
      Editor or Oxygen XML Author.</p>
    <p>This guide provides instructions and information about everything the <b>Content Author</b>
      has access to in regards to <ph keyref="product"/>.</p>
