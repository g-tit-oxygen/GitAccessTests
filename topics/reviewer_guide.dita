    <p>The <b>Reviewer</b> refers to subject matter experts or other team members who are asked to
      review documentation that has been uploaded to the <ph keyref="product"/> server by the
        <b>Content Author</b>. The <b>Reviewer</b> simply clicks on a link that is sent to them to
      access the task that contains the documents to be reviewed in their default browser. They can
      open each file to proofread, add comments, and make changes in a simple, visual editor. If
      they want other <b>Reviewers</b> to look at the documents, they can share the task with them
      and all of them can communicate with each other and the <b>Content Author</b> throughout the
      review process. Once the <b>Reviewer</b> finishes the review process, the <b>Content
        Author</b> will have the ability to merge all of the changes.</p>
    <p>This guide provides instructions and information about everything the <b>Reviewer</b> has
      access to in regards to <ph keyref="product"/>.</p>
