      <p>If this is your first time using <ph keyref="product"/>, you need to create an account by
        following these steps:<ol>
          <li>If you have an active GitHub or Google account, you can simply click either of those
            two buttons and allow <ph keyref="product"/> to use those credentials. Otherwise,
            proceed to the next step.<note><ph keyref="product"/> only uses your social account to
              read your name and email address. No other data is accessed.</note><note><ph
                keyref="product"/> requires a valid email address to complete your account sign-up
              process. Even if you choose to login using a social account, the email address
              associated with that account might not be public (this is the default case for
              GitHub). In this case, <ph keyref="product"/> asks you to provide one.</note></li>
          <li>Click on <uicontrol>SIGN UP</uicontrol> and enter your name, a valid email address,
            and a password.</li>

          <li>Click the <uicontrol>Sign Up</uicontrol> button at the bottom.</li>
          <li>Open the email that is sent to the email address you entered and use the link to
            verify your email address.</li>
          <li>Click <uicontrol>Authorize</uicontrol> to finalize the account creation process.</li>
