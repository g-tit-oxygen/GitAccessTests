      <title>Problem</title>
      <p>Some anti-virus software can cause Java applications, such as <ph keyref="product"/>, to
        start very slowly due to scanning of compressed archives (such as the <term>JAR</term>
        libraries that all Java applications use).</p>

      <title>Solution</title>
      <p>A possible solution is to add the <ph keyref="product"/> folder to the list of exceptions
        in the anti-virus software settings.</p>
