      <title>Problem</title>
      <p>I cannot connect to a SVN repository from the <uicontrol>Repositories</uicontrol> view of
        SVN Client. How can I find more details about the error?</p>

      <title>Solution</title>
      <p>First check that you entered the correct URL of the repository in the
          <uicontrol>Repositories</uicontrol> view. Also check that a SVN server is running on the
        server machine specified in the repository URL and is accepting connections from SVN
        clients. You can check that the SVN server accepts connections with the command line SVN
        client from CollabNet. </p>
      <p>If you try to access the repository with a <codeph>svn+ssh</codeph> URL also check that a
        SSH server is running on port 22 on the server machine specified in the URL. </p>
      <p>If the above conditions are verified and you cannot connect to the SVN repository please
        generate a logging file on your computer and send the logging file to <ph
          keyref="supportEmail"/>. For generating a logging file you need to create a text file
        called <filepath>log4j.properties</filepath> in the install folder with the following
        content:</p>
      <codeblock outputclass="language-ini">log4j.rootCategory= debug, R2

log4j.appender.R2=org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender
log4j.appender.R2.File=logging.log
log4j.appender.R2.MaxFileSize=12000KB
log4j.appender.R2.MaxBackupIndex=20
log4j.appender.R2.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.R2.layout.ConversionPattern=%r %p [ %t ] %c - %m%n</codeblock>
      <p>Restart the application, reproduce the error, close the application and send the file
          <filepath>logging.log</filepath> generated in the install directory to <ph
          keyref="supportEmail"/>.</p>
