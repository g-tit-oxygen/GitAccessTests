  <title>Special Characters are Replaced with a Square in Editor</title>

      <title>Problem</title>
      <p>My file was created with other application and it contains special characters (such as é,
        ©, ®, etc.) Why does <ph keyref="product"/> display a square for these characters when I
        open the file in <ph keyref="product"/>?</p>

      <title>Solution</title>
      <p>You must set a font able to render the special characters in the <xref
          href="preferences-fonts.dita"><uicontrol>Font</uicontrol> preferences</xref>. If it is a
        text file you must also set <xref href="preferences-encoding.dita">the encoding used for non
          XML files</xref>. If you want to set a font that is installed on your computer but that
        font is not accessible in the <uicontrol>Font</uicontrol> preferences, this means the Java
        virtual machine is not able to load the system fonts (probably because it is not a True Type
        font). It is a problem of the Java virtual machine and a possible solution is to copy the
        font file in the <filepath>[JVM_DIR]/lib/fonts</filepath> folder.
          <filepath>[JVM_DIR]</filepath> is the value of the property <i>java.home</i> that is
        available in the <uicontrol>System properties</uicontrol> tab of the
          <uicontrol>About</uicontrol> dialog box that is opened from menu <menucascade>
          <uicontrol>Help</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>About</uicontrol>
        </menucascade>.</p>
