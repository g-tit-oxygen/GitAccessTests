      <p>If an error exception is detected, a warning icon (<image href="../img/Error18.png"/>) will
        be displayed at the top-left corner of the <uicontrol>Content Fusion Tasks
          Manager</uicontrol> view. Clicking the icon will display details about the particular
        exception in the <uicontrol>Results</uicontrol> panel at the bottom of Oxygen XML
        Editor/Author. If you need to report a problem to the Oxygen technical support team,
        right-click the entry in the <uicontrol>Results</uicontrol> panel and select
          <uicontrol>Report problem</uicontrol>. This opens a dialog box that allows you to select

      <p>If this message is displayed at the top of the <uicontrol>Content Fusion Tasks
          Manager</uicontrol> view after you try to upload a task, it means that there is a problem
        with your user account (for example, if you chose to delete your account in the <xref
          href="account_management.dita#account_management/profile_page"
            ><uicontrol>Profile</uicontrol> page</xref>). To solve this, click
          <uicontrol>Connect</uicontrol> to open the <ph keyref="product"/> interface in your most
        recently used browser, then click on <xref href="account_management.dita#account_management"
            ><uicontrol>SIGN UP</uicontrol> and follow the instructions to re-create your
          account</xref>. After verifying your email address, don't forget to click the
          <uicontrol>Authorize</uicontrol> button in the <ph keyref="product"/> interface.</p>

      <title>Review Task Details Not Available</title>
      <p>If you see this message in the <ph keyref="product"/> interface when clicking on the name

    <section id="oxygen_needs_more_memory_to_upload_the_task">
      <title>Oxygen Needs More Memory to Upload the Task</title>
      <p>If uploading a task fails and the error message suggests that a possible cause may be that
        Oxygen needs more memory to upload the task, see <xref
          href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/ug-editor/topics/increase-memory.html" format="html"

      <p>When <xref href="merging_changes.dita#merging_changes">merging changes</xref>, if this
        message appears in the <uicontrol>Results</uicontrol> panel at the bottom of Oxygen XML

    <section id="reviewers_see_variable_key_references_expanded_as">
      <title>Reviewers see Variable Key References Expanded as an Unexpected Value</title>
      <p>Since the Oxygen Web Author editor that the <b>Reviewers</b> use to proofread and make
        changes to uploaded files is a lightweight version of Oxygen XML Editor/Author, it does not
        have all of the features that the <b>Content Author</b> has access to. For example, in
        Oxygen XML Editor/Author, the <b>Content Author</b> can select which value they want to see
        expanded for defined variable key references. In the Oxygen Web Author editor, the
          <b>Reviewers</b> will only see the first value that is detected.</p>
