      <title>Problem</title>
      <p>I cannot associate the <ph keyref="product"/> application with a file type on my Windows
        computer by right clicking a file in Windows Explorer, selecting <menucascade>
          <uicontrol>Open With</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>Choose Program</uicontrol>
        </menucascade> and browsing to the file <ph keyref="executable"/>. When I select the file
          <ph keyref="executable"/> in the Windows file browser dialog box, the <ph keyref="product"
        /> application is not added to the list of applications in the <uicontrol>Open
          With</uicontrol> dialog box. What can I do?</p>

      <p>The problem is due to some garbage Windows registry entries remained from versions of <ph
          keyref="product"/> older than version 9.0. Uninstall all your installed versions of <ph
          keyref="product"/> and run a registry cleaner application for cleaning these older
        entries. After that just reinstall your current version of <ph keyref="product"/> and try
        again to create the file association.</p>
