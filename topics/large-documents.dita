        <p>Consider the case of documenting a large project. It is likely that there will be several
      people involved. The resulting document can be few megabytes in size. The question becomes how
      to deal with this amount of data in such a way that work parallelism will not be affected.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, XML provides two solutions for this: <b>DTD Entities</b> and
        <b>XInclude</b>. A master document can be created, with references to the other
      document parts, containing the document sections. The users can edit the documents
      individually, then apply an XSLT stylesheet over the master and obtain the output files in
      various formats (for example, PDF or HTML).</p>
