  <title>Wrong Highlights of Matched Words in a Search in User Manual</title>
  <body>

      <title>Problem</title>
      <p>When I do a keyword search in the User Manual that is included with the <ph
          keyref="product"/> application, the search highlights the wrong word in the text.
        Sometimes the highlighted word is several words after the matched word. What can I do to get
        correct highlights?</p>

      <p>This does not happen when <ph keyref="product"/> runs with a built-in Java virtual machine,
        that is a JVM that was installed by <ph keyref="product"/> in a subfolder of the
        installation folder (for example, on Windows and Linux when installing <ph keyref="product"
        /> with the installation wizard specific for that platform). When <ph keyref="product"/>
        runs from an All Platforms installation, it uses whatever JVM was found on the host system,
        which may be incompatible with the JavaHelp indexer used for creating the built-in User
        Manual. Such a JVM may offset the highlight of the matched word with several characters,
        usually to the right of the matched word. To see the highlight exactly on the matched word,
        it is recommended to install the application with the specific installation wizard for your
        platform (available only for Windows and Linux).</p>
