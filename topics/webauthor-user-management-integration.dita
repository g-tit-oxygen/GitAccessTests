      external user management service. This allows you to manage permissions and authentication,
      display the name of the user in comments and tracked changes, or customize the interface
      according to a user profile.</p>

      <title>User Authentication</title>
      <p>Users do not have to login to the Web Author server itself. However, they need to give Web
        Author permissions to access files on their behalf. This is usually handled through the use
        of a <xref

          >file storage connector plugin</xref> and by <xref

          mechanism</xref>.</p>

      <title>User Name</title>
      <p>The name of the user is used by Web Author for comments and tracked changes. To configure
        the editor to display the correct name, you simply need to <xref

          >construct a target URL and use the <apiname>author</apiname> parameter</xref> to specify
        the user's name.</p>

      <title>Customizing the UI According to User Profile</title>
      <p>In most cases, <ph keyref="webappProduct"/> is used by diverse groups of people composed of
        subject matter experts, support teams, technical writers, and other content contributors and
        reviewers. In many cases, it makes sense to customize the complexity of the user interface
        according to the user profile. This allows you to simplify the user interface for particular
        types of users so that they only have access to features that are relevant for their
        particular usage.</p>
      <p>Some of the things that you can customize for particular users include:<ul
