    <p>XML documents can be transformed into a variety of user-friendly output formats that can be
      viewed by other users. This process is known as a <i>transformation</i>.</p>
    <p><ph keyref="product"/> allows you to use transformation scenarios to publish XML content in
      various output formats (such as WebHelp, PDF, CHM, EPUB, JavaHelp, Eclipse Help, XHTML, etc.) </p>
    <p>For transformations that are not included in your installed version of <ph keyref="product"
      />, simply install the tool chain required to perform the specific transformation and process
      the files in accordance with the processor instructions. A multitude of target formats are
      possible. The basic condition for transformation to any format is that your source document is
      well-formed.</p>
    <note>You need to use the appropriate stylesheet according to the source definition and the
      desired output. For example, if you want to transform into an HTML format using a DocBook
      stylesheet, your source XML document should conform with the DocBook DTD.</note>
