    <p>The following procedure assumes that your <ph keyref="product"/> HTTP floating license server
      contains a previously <xref
        href="../topics/floating-license-servlet-setup.dita#floating-license-servlet-setup/activate-li"
        >activated license key</xref> and provides instructions for replacing it with another one.
      The goal of the procedure is to allow you to activate and configure the new license key
      without any downtime.</p>
    <p>This is useful if, for instance, you want to upgrade your existing license to the latest
      version or if you receive a new license key <xref
        href="installation-setting-up-license-server.dita#installation-setting-up-license-server/split_combine_floating"
        >that accommodates a different number of users</xref>.</p>
    <p>To replace a floating license key that is activated on your HTTP floating license server with
      a new one, follow these steps:<ol id="ul_scf_3jt_wr">
        <li>Access the license server by following the link provided by the Tomcat Web Application
          Manager page.</li>
        <li>Click the <uicontrol>Replace license key</uicontrol> link. This will open a page that
          contains details about the license currently in use.</li>
        <li>Click the <uicontrol>Yes</uicontrol> button to begin the replacement procedure.</li>
        <li>Paste the new floating license key in the displayed form, then click
            <uicontrol>Submit</uicontrol>. The browser used in the process needs to have Internet
            access.<p>You will be redirected to an online form hosted on the <ph keyref="product"/>
            website. This form is pre-filled with an activation code that uniquely identifies your
            license server deployment and your license key.<note>If for some reason your browser
              does not take you to this activation form, refer to the <xref
                href="../topics/floating-license-servlet-setup.dita#floating-license-servlet-setup/manual_activation_proc"
                >Manual Activation Procedure</xref>. </note></p></li>
        <li>Press <uicontrol>Activate</uicontrol>. <p>If the activation process is completed
            successfully, your license server is now running using the new license key. You can
            click <uicontrol>View license key</uicontrol> to inspect the key currently used by the
            license server.</p></li>
      </ol></p>
