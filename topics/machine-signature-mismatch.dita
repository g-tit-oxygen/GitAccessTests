      <title>Problem</title>
      <p>During the TCP floating license activation process, the license key becomes bound to a
        particular license server deployment. This means that a code that uniquely identifies your
        license server deployment (called <term>Machine Signature</term>) is sent to the <ph
          keyref="product"/> servers, which in turn will sign the license key. The <term>Machine
          Signature</term> is computed from the list of network interfaces of the machine where you
        deployed the floating license.</p>

      <p>When starting the license server, if you receive an error stating that your server's
        Machine Signature does not match the one found in your license key, there are several
        possible causes:<ul>
          <li>You have moved your floating license key to a new machine that hosts your license
            server. </li>
          <li>You have changed, added, or activated a new network interface in the machine that
            hosts your license server.<note>A specific example of when this could happen, is if you
              activate/deactivate the Bluetooth module or the WiFi module.</note></li>
        </ul></p>
