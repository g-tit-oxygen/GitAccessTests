      <p>Usually this happens when a special keyboard layout is set in the operating system that
        generates other characters than the usual ones for the keys of a standard keyboard. For
        example if you set the extended Greek layout for your keyboard you should return to the
        default Greek layout or to the English one. Otherwise, the Java virtual machine that runs
        the application will receive other key codes than the usual ones for a standard
        keyboard.</p>
